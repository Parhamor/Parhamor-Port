This is an **example project page**, just like the README page/project.

On each project you can write any type of content you like, with standard **text** _formating features_.

When you are done reading, move on to the third page, to learn [how to create and edit content](create-edit-content).



# Medias

Of course it is also possible to add more images to a project. Like the following.

## Images

Same goes for any type of iframe, that can as well be inserted.

## `<iframe>` (HTML)

<iframe width="100%" height="120" src="https://www.mixcloud.com/widget/iframe/?hide_cover=1&feed=%2Fterahertzradiation%2Fbergamote-terahertz-radiation%2F" frameborder="0" ></iframe>

## Videos

In the same fashion, **videos** can easily be embedded inside any page.

<iframe width="100%" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C_vy0TY8m98" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe>

## HTML5 & Widgets

### HTML5 and CSS

You can also write any type of content in HTML and CSS.

<p>
 <span style="color: purple;">Such as this</span>,
 <span style="color: green;">this</span>,
 <span style="font-size: 3rem;">or that</span>.
</p>

You can use any markup allowed by HTML or CSS.

### Widget, Instagram example

Do you want to integrate a feed of your instagram images?

It's pretty easy! You can do this in any project or page of your site.

[Follow these instructions](https://instagram.internet4000.com/).

<i4k-image-feed instagram-access-token="7110945664.db1fb5e.d769baf2fbb4415295e5e537ec8a7e41"></i4k-image-feed><script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/i4k-image-feed" async=""></script>
